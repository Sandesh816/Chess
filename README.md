(Chess_Project_Team10_Final) is the main working program. Brain.java (inside src) does the most of the work.

This is our Chess project. We have attempted to make a variation of a regular Chess game. Initially, when we set up the Board, we will only have kings
and pawns set up in their usual location. Then, we will allow players to locate their remaining pieces (queen, knights, etc.) wherever they want
on their side of the board. 

But be wary though, if you place your queen too close to the enemy side, it can easily be attacked or captured. Or if you place your pieces too 
defensively, then you opponent can get advantage even before the game starts because of their active pieces. So, it will bring an interesting
dynamic in the game. Also, if both players agree, then they can press the Randomize button, which will bring a luck factor in the game. Randomize will
place the remaining pieces in random location, and (maybe) bring out an interesting capture fest.

Our variation of the game will also include one key element-- Hints. Each player will have three hint options throughout the game. Players can press
hint anytime, and the best move suggested by stockfish will be shown on the board. As both players have equal number of hints and they can press
it anytime during the game, the game will still remain fair, and it will be strategic on when the players want to use the hint.
